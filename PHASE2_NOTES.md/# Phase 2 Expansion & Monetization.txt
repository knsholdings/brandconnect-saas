# Phase 2: Expansion & Monetization for BrandConnect SaaS
## March 1 - March 7, 2025 (Week 1)

### Goals
- Develop the SaaS Management Admin Panel (React frontend).
- Implement Stripe integration for subscription and billing.
- Set up usage analytics and reporting system.

### Progress
- **March 1, 2025**:
  - Installed Node.js (v22.14.0), npm (v10.9.2), and npx (v10.9.2) to set up the React frontend.
  - Created and cleaned up the `frontend` directory in `D:\brandconnect-saas` using `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`.
  - Installed dependencies (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `axios`, `react-router-dom`) in the `frontend` directory.
  - Coded the React admin panel with role-based routing, navigation, and placeholder components for User Management, Billing, and Analytics.
  - Verified backend stability for Phase 1, ensuring migrations and `/users/create` work on Heroku.

### Action Items
- Complete Stripe billing implementation with placeholder key by March 3, 2025.
- Implement usage analytics tracking and reporting by March 3, 2025.
- Test frontend-backend integration locally and prepare for Heroku/Vercel deployment by March 7, 2025.

### Notes
- `create-react-app` is deprecated; consider migrating to Vite or Next.js for future updates.
- Stripe integration uses a placeholder `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` until an account is set up.
- Monitor Heroku logs for backend stability and Vercel logs for frontend deployment.
