# Phase 2: Expansion & Monetization for BrandConnect SaaS
## March 1 - March 7, 2025 (Week 1)

### Progress
- **March 1, 2025**:
  - Installed Node.js (v22.14.0), npm (v10.9.2), and npx (v10.9.2) to set up the React frontend.
  - Created and cleaned up the `frontend` directory in `D:\brandconnect-saas` using `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`, resolving conflicts by removing existing files.
  - Installed dependencies (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `axios`, `react-router-dom`) in the `frontend` directory.
  - Coded the React admin panel with role-based routing, navigation (Dashboard, User Management, Billing, Analytics), and placeholder components, tested locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
  - Verified backend stability for Phase 1, ensuring migrations and `/users/create` work on Heroku (pending final confirmation from migrations).
  - Shared a status update with Barb via email/Slack, outlining Phase 1 finalization and Phase 2 plans.

### Action Items
- Complete Stripe billing implementation with placeholder key by March 3, 2025.
- Implement usage analytics tracking and reporting by March 3, 2025.
- Test frontend-backend integration locally and prepare for Heroku/Vercel deployment by March 7, 2025.
